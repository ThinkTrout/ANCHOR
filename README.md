## The Reef awaits, Diver. . .
</span>

The **Reef** is a dimension shaped by collective human thought. Until the **Flood**, we never knew of its existence.

The year is 2081. 50 years ago, the **Flood** caused the metaphysical barrier between our reality and the **Reef** to break down, causing a global catastrophe that resulted in irreversible damage to modern infrastructure and society as we know it.

As a **Diver**, a heavily-armed special unit equipped to deal with the supernatural hostility of **Shallow Waters**, zones where the **Reef** bleeds into our reality, you will be sent to explore and investigate these zones.

You will come across **Coral Structures**, physical manifestations of human thoughts that grow at unpredictable rates influenced by the mental stability of humans near them.

Toe assist you, you will be equipped with all manner of guns and equipment to navigate Coral-infested buildings, repair unstable pockets of reality, and investigate the secrets of private military companies that have their own interests in the **Reef**.

**The Reef awaits, Diver. How will *you* navigate its waters?**
