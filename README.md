## The Reef awaits, Diver. . .
</span>

The **Reef** is a dimension shaped by collective human thought. Until the **Flood**, we never knew of its existence.

The year is **2081**. 50 years ago, an event known as the **Flood** caused the metaphysical barrier between our reality and the **Reef** to break down, causing a global catastrophe that resulted in irreversible damage to modern infrastructure and society as we know it.

As a **Diver**, a heavily-armed special unit trained to deal with the supernatural hostility of **Shallow Waters**—zones where the **Reef** bleeds into our reality—you will be sent to explore and investigate these zones.

**Explore Shallow Waters**\
Navigate zones where the Reef merges with reality, uncovering its secrets and dangers.

**Face Coral Structures**\
Encounter rapidly growing manifestations of human thought that infest and rewrite reality itself.

**Combat Supernatural Threats**\
Use a variety of weapons and equipment to fight hostile entities and repair unstable pockets of reality.

**Uncover Hidden Agendas**\
Investigate the secrets of private military companies with their own interests in the Reef.

**The Reef awaits, Diver. How will *you* navigate its waters?**
